# Rock-Paper-Scissor
Description
This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using Python's tkinter library. The game allows the user to choose between "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors", and the system will randomly select one of these options. The winner is determined based on the following rules:

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
The game keeps track of the scores, including the number of wins for both the player and the computer, as well as the number of ties.
